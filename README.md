Numerical calculation of slotted ALOHA performance models:
- basic.py 
	Basic model: no retransmission, poisson arrival rate. Plots throughput, collisions and idle slots
- mchain.py
	Markov chain model, with retransmission probability as a parameter.
- stability.py
	Additions for markov chain model, plots backlog and throughput and illustrates stability concerns
